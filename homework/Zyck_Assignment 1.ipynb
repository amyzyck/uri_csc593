    "Juvenile marine mussels, called spat, were collected from 5 intertidal sites in Southwest England between April and September of 2012. These spat are typically found attached to clumps of red algae, so an average of 5 algal clumps were collected from each site on each sampling day. Spat were then removed from the algal clump, measured, checked for an eyespot, and then preserved for further genetic analysis. Algal clumps were weighed before and after spat were removed to obtain dry weight measurements for density calculations. "
